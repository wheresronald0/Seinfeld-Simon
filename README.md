## This project is / should be used for

This project was my first JavaScript project ever at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. Although the code is extremely WET, I've chosen not to refactor to preserve the benchmark.

## List of Features / User Stories (MVP/ Bronze)

- The game in made up of four picture tiles in which a user is required to select, mirroring the order that the computer highlights
- The initial round starts with one tile being highlighted, and increases by one tile each subsquent round
- At the end of each round the user will be notified if they've passed of failed the round. If the result is failed, the game ends
- There are instructions on the page so the user can educate themselves on how to play the game
- Once the user is familiar with the strategy and rules, there is a start button to initiate the game, and a reset button to start over

## Advanced Features (Silver/Gold)

- Round tracking to indicate the round
- High score
- multi-player competition
- Sound indication when a tile highlights or is pushed

## Technologies Used

This game was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
